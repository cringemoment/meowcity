      <h2>what the heck is this website?</h2>
      <p>
        furiously cobbled together in a week, <a href = "https://cringemoment.neocities.org">cringemoment.neocities.org</a> is a little passion project i dragged my friend into helping with for an english project that did not call for it. the reviews section is notably lacking, and that's because the point of the project was to analyze the Netflix original The Social Dilemna, and so most of the other stuff on the website is filler to try and make it look more like a regular personal blog.
      </p>
      <h2>why the weird aesthetic?</h2>
      <p>
        im like weirdly obsessed with the style of specifically neocities website, which harken back to the internet days before social media really came along. one part of the rubric is to create media that follows standard conventions, and i felt like i knew enough about the standard early 2000's website architecture that i could hit this criteria. plus its like meta commentary on social media.
      </p>
      <h2>design choices...</h2>
      <p>
        i tried to have everything a fairly standard website like this should have; the title, nav frame, and the main content box. i'm no artist, so everthings kinda unfortunately lacking in design quality but i like to think i tried my best!!! as with every personal page i also threw in some personalization but again, no art skills; my entire toolset is tetris and front end design (qwp).
